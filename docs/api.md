  "topics": [{ "topicName": "send-email", "lockDuration": 30000 }]
}

POST /engine-rest/external-task/:id/complete   { "workerId": "...", "variables": {...} }

```

## History

```http

## Incidents

```http
GET    /engine-rest/incident
GET    /engine-rest/incident/:id
DELETE /engine-rest/incident/:id
POST   /engine-rest/job/:id/retries   { "retries": 3 }
```

## Audit Trail & Token-History Replay

Every state transition (process start/complete/terminate/suspend, execution created/moved/waited/completed, task created/claimed/completed/cancelled, job locked/completed/failed, gateway fork/join, timer created/triggered/cancelled, message correlation, signal broadcast) is written to `audit_logs`. The token-history endpoint turns that raw trail into an ordered, human-readable path — this is what the frontend's diagram replay (play/pause/step/scrub, see below) consumes.

```http
# Raw audit log for an instance, chronological
GET /engine-rest/audit/process/:processId

# Derived token path: one step per element the token visited, with a
# readable `detail` string and (where applicable) an `elementId` you can
# highlight on the BPMN diagram
GET /engine-rest/audit/process/:processId/token-history

GET  /engine-rest/audit/task/:taskId
POST /engine-rest/audit/date-range   { "start": "...", "end": "..." }
```

## Real-Time Events

```http
# Server-Sent Events (HTTP streaming)
GET /events/tasks

# WebSocket
ws://localhost:8080/ws/tasks
```

## Camunda 8 REST API (`/v2/...`)

Parallel to the Camunda-7-style surface above, the same engine is exposed with Camunda 8 ("Orchestration Cluster") request/response shapes — same underlying services, translated shapes only.

```http
POST /v2/deployments                          (also POST /v2/resources/deployments)
POST /v2/process-definitions/:key/start
POST /v2/process-instances
GET  /v2/process-instances/:id
POST /v2/process-instances/search
POST /v2/process-instances/:id/modification   (Move Token)

POST /v2/jobs/activation                      (fetch-and-lock equivalent)
POST /v2/jobs/:id/completion
POST /v2/jobs/:id/failure
POST /v2/jobs/:id/error

POST /v2/user-tasks/search
POST /v2/user-tasks/:id/assignment            (claim/unclaim)
POST /v2/user-tasks/:id/completion

POST /v2/messages/publication
POST /v2/signals/broadcast

POST /v2/decisions/:key/evaluation            (DMN, no process instance needed)
GET  /v2/forms/:formKey

POST /v2/flownode-instances/search
POST /v2/incidents/search
POST /v2/variables/search
```

`POST /v2/messages/publication` and the gRPC `PublishMessage` follow Camunda 8: the message goes to the subscriptions whose `zeebe:subscription correlationKey` evaluates to the published `correlationKey` — at most once per process — or starts the processes waiting on it with a message start event. With a `timeToLive` (ms), it is kept and correlates to subscriptions that open later; a `messageId` already published and alive is refused (409 / `ALREADY_EXISTS`). Nothing waiting is not an error. Processes without a `correlationKey` expression keep matching a key equal to their `correlationKey` variable, as before. `POST /engine-rest/message` keeps Camunda 7's semantics.
